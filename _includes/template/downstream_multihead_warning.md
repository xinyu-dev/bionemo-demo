Currently, we only support multi-head finetuning (e.g. multiple target columns in the same dataset) for token level classification tasks. It is not supported for seqeunce level classification or regression tasks out of box. You can customize the head in `workspace/bionemo/bionemo/model/protein/downstream/protein_model_finetuning.py`, under `build_task_head` function. The loss function can be customized under `build_loss_fn` in the same file.
