2 datasets were used during ESM2 training. Uniref50 is split as train, val, test. To increase data size and diversity, during training, a minibatch of uniref50 were sampled. Each sequence in this batch was replaced with a sequence from its corresponding uniref90 cluster. See [original paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.20.500902v1.full#:~:text=To%20increase%20the%20amount%20of%20data%20and%20its%20diversity%2C%20we%20sampled%20a%20minibatch%20of%20UniRef50%20sequences%20for%20each%20training%20update.%20We%20then%20replaced%20each%20sequence%20with%20a%20sequence%20sampled%20uniformly%20from%20the%20corresponding%20UniRef90%20cluster.%20This%20allowed%20ESM%2D2%20models%20to%20train%20on%20over%2060M%20protein%20sequences.) for details. Uniref90 is only used in training but not in validation/test.
